# Hello-world
a new repository

Hi,there,I'm Jonathan. I'm currently a college student in China. I'm interested in Natual Language Processing and now I'm learning Machine learning on Coursera, and reading Speech and Language Processing with a very slow pace(because of my low English vocabulary and poor understanding ability to English). Of course, all these thing need so much time and enerage and hard to digest these information, but I'm still enjoying to learn, hope oneday I can join some projects that I can accomplish some works that I can contribute to real world.

This text file is a simple record of my own learning process, I'll be so glad that if my own thoughts can inspire anyone who want to get on this road to become a learner in AI, wish to develop skills with all learners on Internet
